                               orgutils:
                    Personal Organization Utilities

orgutils are a set of utilities for personal and project organization.
Each program has its respective manual page.

The programs included in orgutils are the following.
• calendar:     Print upcoming events.
• todo:         Print next tasks.
• agenda:       Print calendar, events and tasks.

The following programs are planned to be included in orgutils:
• schedule:     Convert tasks into events.
• habit:        Habits tracker.
• clock:        Clock time spent in activities.

These programs were written to be scriptable.  They are non-interactive
filters[1] that do not do colored output or other forms of pretty-printing,
so their output can be used by other utilities, in a shell pipeline for
example.
